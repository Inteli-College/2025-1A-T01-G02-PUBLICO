# **Module 2 Report – Volatility Curve Fitting in the Options Market**

## Sprint 1

During the first sprint, the initial planning of the module was carried out, focusing on the organization and completion of the official documentation required by the academic institution. In addition, the algorithm developed in the previous module was refactored to improve code readability and efficiency, aligning it with best development practices.

## Sprint 2

In the second sprint, a thorough analysis of potential journals for article submission was conducted. Academic journals, magazines, and renowned conferences were considered. After evaluating the options, it was decided to submit the article to *IEEE Magazine* due to its visibility and thematic alignment.

## Sprint 3

During the third sprint, the methodology section of the article was written, providing a detailed description of the algorithm’s application and the tests carried out. Additionally, the introduction was initiated, including the contextualization of the research problem and the definition of the study’s objectives.

## Sprint 4

The fourth sprint focused on completing the introduction and writing the results section. Tables and quantitative analyses were included, accompanied by a critical interpretation of the data, strengthening the scientific argumentation of the article.

## Sprint 5

In the fifth and final sprint, the article’s conclusion was developed and the complete manuscript underwent a thorough revision. It was decided to adopt the *IEEE Access* template, considering the possibility of publishing in that journal. Furthermore, feedback from the peer review process was incorporated to enhance the final quality of the work.
